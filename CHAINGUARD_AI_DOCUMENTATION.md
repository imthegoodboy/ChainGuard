## Overview

**ChainGuard AI** is an autonomous AI-powered smart contract security platform built exclusively on the Polygon network. We provide real-time, continuous vulnerability detection and monitoring for smart contracts at a fraction of the cost of traditional security audits.

### Mission
To democratize smart contract security by making enterprise-grade protection accessible to every developer, from indie builders to large organizations.

### Vision
Create a self-improving, community-powered security network where every attack makes the entire ecosystem stronger.

---

## The Problem We Solve

### Massive Financial Losses
- **$3.8 billion** lost to smart contract exploits in 2023 alone
- Most victims are small teams and indie developers who couldn't afford proper security
- 70% of hacks occur in contracts that were never professionally audited

### Prohibitive Audit Costs
- Traditional security audits cost **$50,000 - $200,000**
- Takes 2-4 weeks to complete
- Only large, well-funded projects can afford them
- By the time you get audited, your code may have changed

### Speed of Attacks
- Hackers can identify and exploit vulnerabilities in **minutes**
- Traditional audits take **weeks**
- No continuous monitoring after deployment
- Zero-day vulnerabilities emerge constantly

### Accessibility Gap
- 90% of smart contract developers have never had a professional audit
- Existing tools require deep security expertise
- Most security solutions are reactive, not proactive
- No affordable real-time monitoring solutions exist

---

## How It Works

### Step 1: User Registration & Authentication
1. User visits ChainGuard AI website
2. Creates account with email/password
3. Receives 5 free scans automatically
4. No credit card required to start

### Step 2: Contract Scanning

**Option A: File Upload**
1. User clicks "Upload File" tab
2. Selects .sol (Solidity) file from computer
3. Names the contract
4. Clicks "Scan for Vulnerabilities"
5. AI analyzes code in 2-3 seconds
6. Receives comprehensive vulnerability report

**Option B: GitHub Integration**
1. User clicks "GitHub URL" tab
2. Pastes direct link to .sol file on GitHub
3. System fetches code automatically
4. Clicks "Scan for Vulnerabilities"
5. AI analyzes code in 2-3 seconds
6. Receives comprehensive vulnerability report

### Step 3: Understanding Results

**Risk Score Calculation:**
- Critical vulnerability = 40 points
- High vulnerability = 25 points
- Medium vulnerability = 15 points
- Low vulnerability = 5 points
- Total score capped at 100

**Risk Levels:**
- 0-24: Low Risk (Green) - Minor issues, safe to deploy
- 25-49: Medium Risk (Yellow) - Address before mainnet
- 50-74: High Risk (Orange) - Serious issues, fix immediately
- 75-100: Critical Risk (Red) - Do not deploy

**Report Contents:**
For each vulnerability:
- **Severity:** Critical/High/Medium/Low
- **Category:** Type of vulnerability (Reentrancy, Gas Limit, etc.)
- **Description:** Plain English explanation of the risk
- **Location:** Exact line number or function name
- **Recommendation:** Step-by-step fix instructions
- **Code Snippet:** Highlighted problematic code

### Step 4: Fixing Vulnerabilities
1. User reads recommendations in plain English
2. Applies suggested fixes to contract code
3. Re-scans to verify fixes (uses another scan)
4. Repeats until risk score is acceptable
5. Deploys with confidence

### Step 5: Upgrade to Pro (Optional)

**When Free Scans Run Out:**
1. User clicks "Connect Wallet" in navigation
2. MetaMask prompts connection
3. System switches to Polygon network automatically
4. User authorizes connection
5. Wallet address is linked to account

**Upgrading:**
1. User clicks "Upgrade to Pro" button
