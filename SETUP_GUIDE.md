# ChainGuard AI - Setup Guide

## Quick Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup

Your `.env` file is already configured with Supabase credentials. The application is ready to connect to the database.

### 2. Database

The database is already set up with the following tables:
- `profiles` - User accounts and subscription management
- `contract_scans` - Security scan history
- `monitored_contracts` - Live monitoring configurations
- `security_alerts` - Real-time threat notifications
- `payments` - Payment transaction records

All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled for data protection.

2. Click "Get Started" or "Start Free Scan"
3. Sign up with email/password
4. Automatically receives 5 free scans
5. Navigate to Scanner
6. Upload contract or paste GitHub URL
7. Receive instant security report
8. View vulnerabilities with recommendations
9. Fix issues and re-scan

#### Free to Pro Upgrade

### 6. Free Tier Limits

The application enforces free tier limits:
- Maximum 5 scans per account
- Counter tracked in database
- UI shows remaining scans
- Scanner blocks scans after limit
- Prompts to upgrade or connect wallet

### 7. Polygon Integration

**Network Details:**
- Chain ID: 137 (Polygon Mainnet)
- Native Token: MATIC
- RPC: https://polygon-rpc.com/
- Block Explorer: https://polygonscan.com/

**Features:**
- Automatic network detection
- Auto-switch to Polygon if on wrong network
- Add Polygon network if not present
- Transaction simulation (demo mode)

### 8. AI Vulnerability Detection

**Detected Patterns:**
- Reentrancy attacks
- Gas limit issues
- tx.origin authentication
- selfdestruct vulnerabilities
- delegatecall risks
- Block timestamp dependence
- Private variable misuse
- Unchecked arithmetic
- Missing compiler pragma
- Access control issues
- Missing reentrancy guards

**Risk Scoring:**
- Critical = 40 points
- High = 25 points
- Medium = 15 points
- Low = 5 points
- Max score = 100

### 9. Testing the Application

#### Test Scan with Sample Contract

Create a test file `TestContract.sol`:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TestContract {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(tx.origin == owner, "Not owner");
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }

    function destroy() public {
        selfdestruct(payable(owner));
    }
}
```

**Expected Results:**
- 2-3 vulnerabilities detected
- Critical: tx.origin usage
- High: selfdestruct without proper protection
- Medium: .transfer() usage
- Risk score: 65-90

#### Test User Journey

1. **Sign Up**: Create account with test email
2. **First Scan**: Upload test contract
3. **View Results**: Check vulnerability report
4. **Use Scans**: Test 5 scan limit
5. **Connect Wallet**: Test MetaMask integration
6. **Upgrade**: Test Pro upgrade flow
7. **Dashboard**: View all data
